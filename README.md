# Hacker Market
This is a monorepo containing all the files for Hacker Market, a Slackbot made entirely for Hack Club's next big YSWS. More details will follow soon!

Built by Charmunk (@isaacfonner) and Mart (@ThatFrogDev)

To develop, please read the READMEs inside the `api` and `bot` directories to set them up. You need to have three terminals to get up and running, one for the API, one for the bot and one for NGROK tunneling.
